Factorability of the data

- KMO based upon polychloric correlation (Rho) was .919
- Bartlett based upon poly corr Rho was less than .05 signaling that the matrix was not an itentiy matrix (diagonals 1 and all other correlations 0)
-Visual review of the corr matrix shows no negative correlations.

Dimension reduction for Trns variable using feature extraction.
- The goal is to perform a conversion from high dimension data to a lower one that accurately represents the orginal by showing the maximum variations in the dataset.
- 8 eigen values above 1, which makes complete sense because youth dev SQIs were taken out!
